# CJK-Portfolio-Page
portfolio page 
#Highlights of the page:#
* The CJK in the header has a hover element. When you hover over the initial it reveals my full name "Cyrus Jalili Khiabani"
* The buttons in the navbar take you to the corresponding section. They also change color and the text gets smaller to give you that pushing down effect on the button.
* The about me section features a bitmoji made from my actual face.
* In the portfolio section I added a link to check out my first assignment. I changed the color and underlined "here".
* I used HTML for the contact me section that is why the section looks a little rough. I think once we learn Javascript I will know how to make a better form taht accepts information.
* In the footer I used unnix to add the heart in my footer message I really like the way that looks.
