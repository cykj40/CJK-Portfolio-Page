            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi may name is Cyrus Khiabani I am a aspiring Web Developer. I am currently working as a construction project manager in Brooklyn NY.   
                My passion is technology and science. Before the pandemic I was living in Los Angeles Ca I was studying to become a chemist. I was attending Santa Monica College and was hoping 
                to transfer to UCLA after finishing 2 years of genral sciences coursework. The last semester of my last year of course work is when the pandemic started.    
                I had to make the best possible choice for me and my fiance. I decided to move back to the east coast to be closer to family. When I got back to New Jersey the first thing 
                I did was apply to Rutgers University I got into the university and ultimatley withdrew from my first semester before it even started because I didnt get any of the classes I wanted 
                my financing fell through it was as if it was not meant to be. I decided to put it off temporarily. I have been practicing coding for many years now. I have taken a lot introductory classes, in many diffrent coding languages 
                that were on the web, mostly from codecademy. I really wasn't gettign anywhere on my own so I decided to get some professional direction. I signed up for the Rutgers Web Development coding bootcamp and here I am doing something completely 
                unexpected and not apart of my original plan when I started on my journey to change my career and life for that matter.
