                <p id="me2">Hi may name is Cyrus Khiabani I am a aspiring Web Developer. I am currently working as a
                    construction
                    project manager in Brooklyn NY for a general contractor specializing in hospital construction.
                    My passion is technology and science. Before the pandemic I was living in Los Angeles Ca I was
                    studying
                    to become a chemist. I attended Santa Monica College for two years and was planning
                    to transfer to UCLA after finishing general sciences coursework and fulfilling a transfer agreement.
                    The
                    last semester of my last year of course work is when the pandemic started. My fianc√© and I decided
                    to
                    move back to the east coast to be closer to family. I have been practicing coding for a few years. I
                    have taken a lot of introductory classes in many different coding languages through codecademy. I
                    wanted
                    to take my coding to the next level I learned a lot of basics but now I wanted to put my knowledge
                    to
                    use and build some websites and applications. So I signed up for the Rutgers Web Development coding
                    bootcamp. This is my portfolio page I am still very new to coding, so I have limited projects to
                    display. I Will be updating it on a consistant basis. I am really happy I decided to start a career
                    in
                    coding and hope everyone will enjoy my work as much as I enjoy making it.
