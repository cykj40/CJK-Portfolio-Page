            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>>Hi may name is Cyrus Khiabani I am a aspiring Web Developer. I am currently working as a construction project manager in Brooklyn NY for a general contractor specializing in hospital construction.   
                My passion is technology and science. Before the pandemic I was living in Los Angeles Ca I was studying to become a chemist. I attended Santa Monica College for two years and was planning 
               to transfer to UCLA after finishing general sciences coursework and fulfilling a transfer agreement. The last semester of my last year of course work is when the pandemic started. My fianc√© and I decided to move back to the east coast to be closer to family. I have been practicing coding for a few years. I have taken a lot of introductory classes in many different coding languages  through codecademy. I wanted to take my coding to the next level I learned a lot of basics but now I wanted to put my knowledge to use and build some websites and applications. So I signed up for the Rutgers Web Development coding bootcamp. This is my portfolio page I am still very new to coding, so I have limited projects to display. I Will be updating it on a consistant basis.   I am really happy I decided to start a career in coding and hope everyone will enjoy my work as much as I enjoy making it.
